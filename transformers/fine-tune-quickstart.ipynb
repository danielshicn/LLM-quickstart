They also sell prepacked sandwiches (far superior to anything you could get from the Subway a few doors down) and homemade soup that's delicious and filling. Until the recent changes in Scottish licensing law, they somehow managed to sell booze long after every other offy had closed (perhaps something to do with the restaurant downstairs?).

So, initially I was super excited to realize that there was a Little Caesar's on Center close to home- though I hate that shopping area because the traffic is always terrible and it's a nightmare getting in and out of. I planned a pizza night with a friend and timed it perfectly to stop in here for hot-and-ready pizzas after work to bring home. I even called in earlier to make sure that I could stop straight in, buy pizzas, and walk out.  I realize that it was right after work when they are probably at their busiest, but I walked in and there were no hot-and-ready pizzas there! Plus, there were only two people working! It upsets me when businesses advertise specials or deals and can't guarantee or follow through with them. I didn't have to wait long (maybe 10-15 min), but I implore Little Caesar's to ONLY promise hot-and-ready pizzas when they are both hot AND ready. On the other hand, the woman behind the counter was intent on getting the pizzas out as soon as possible and was incredibly nice- it's possible that they were simply understaffed for the day. And in their defense, the pizzas were hot and still tasted great- and you can't beat the price! The other items on their menu are a great deal two (i.e., only $3 for crazy bread sticks). With that said, I will definitely be stopping in again for those deals.</td>\n",

Of course it was fresh from the pan so it was steaming in my to go box, although every bite was exactly the same.  It had crunch, I tasted the veggies, but that was about it.  No salty flavor from the soy sauce or any spices to add to the mix.  My wife and I were very disappointed.  Although it could have gone up when we tried the Banh Mi...\\n\\nAnd...another disappointment.  The reason I love Banh Mis are the French baguette crunch, as you bite through the sandwhich it may be a little rough, but the spice and Asian flavors should mix in so well.  I, on the other hand, had a sandwhich which bread was soggy from the juices of the meat/veggies.  From my experience, this should be a somewhat dry sandwhich that relies on the spices and flavor from the meat/veggies to compliment the crispy baguette.  No crispy baguette, and definitely a wet Banh Mi, which I was not looking forward to.  I understand some Banh Mis may be different, but this is definitely not what I am used to from San Diego and LA.\\n\\nI really want to like this place, as we need more great Asian places in Phoenix, but it definitely did not live up to what I expected.
