I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \\\\nI took the tire over to Flynn\\'s and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he\\'d give me a new tire \\\\\"this time\\\\\". \\\\nI will never go back to Flynn\\'s b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire!'\n",

But the ticket guy raved about this show and we got a good deal on tickets ($40 each at the Tix4Less booth) so we bought them. I'm glad we went because it was an awesome experience. \\n\\nWe stayed at the Luxor and this show was thankfully right there in the hotel. The theater was small but comfortable, so everyone essentially had pretty good seats. I had a few guy friends with me and it surprisingly wasn't weird or awkward at all. The dancers were topless yes, but in a very classy, not pornish way. There sets were each pretty short so it was easy to keep everyone's attention. An hour (maybe 90mins?) of hot chicks dancing around on stage with their sickeningly perfect bodies was all the motivation I needed to just stop eating...ever. \\n\\nWhat no one at the hotel really mentioned (which ended up being my favorite parts of the show) when trying to shove the tickets down our throats for 2 days was that there was a host and a comedian as well. Lorena Peril was pretty, charismatic and had a really nice voice. Sean E. Cooper ended up being hilarious (especially his Michael Jackson impersonation -they look NOTHING alike!) and they both actually stole the show. I felt a little bad because they were both funny and doing a good job engaging the audience members, but the back of the room was quiet at times, even though I could sense they were enjoying it. Lol I found myself clapping extra loudly at times just so they knew someone cared. When the lights came on at the end, I saw why. The last few rows were FULL of conservative looking old people and foreign tourists that didn't look like they even knew what was going on. Well it's Vegas and Vegas is full of tourists, so I guess they have come to expect it. I would definitely return with my boyfriend, as I'm sure he would enjoy it = )</td>\n",

About half of us started off with cocktails, I personally got their signature punch which was so delicious &amp; very reasonable during hh for $5 (only at the bar though, not at the table). I don't know why they did, but my bro &amp; mom ordered some apps for everyone, an assortment of tempura (shrimp, scallops &amp; veggies) &amp; edamame. Both were ok but cold, blech. Shortly after we received our soups &amp; salads. The soup was pretty tasty but the salad was drenched in dressing. Everyone ordered something from the teppanyaki menu, except my sis who opted for sashimi &amp; a couple sushi rolls, which she enjoyed. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but my hubby got rocky's choice (steak &amp; chicken) &amp; I got samurai treat (steak &amp; shrimp). \\n\\nOur chef Julio was nice enough but messed up on the tricks quite a few times, isn't that what we're paying for here? Regardless, we all had some laughs &amp; it was fun. The food was ok. I ordered my steak med-rare &amp; some parts were rare while others were pretty well done, not very consistent. They use so much oil &amp; butter yet the food was flavorless, we had to use a lot of extra soy sauce &amp; salt. I'd say the best food item was probably the fried rice, but again it needed extra soy sauce added. A couple of us ordered dessert after dinner, green tea &amp; chocolate ice cream &amp; banana tempura. The ice creams were ok, definitely store bought &amp; seemed a lil old. I didn't try the banana tempura but those who had it said it was ok also. I almost forgot to mention, since it was my dad's birthday they sang to him (which he hated) &amp; took a pic for him to take home (nice touch).\\n\\nI didn't foot the bill but was informed that it was over $500 with tip! There were a few people in our party who had never been before so I'm glad they got to experience it, but when you compare the quality of the food to the price it just doesn't add up. Yes you get a show, but I care more about my food tasting good than some tricks. I would maybe come back for some of their punch during hh &amp; fried rice, but that's about it.</td>\n",
